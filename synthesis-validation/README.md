# Validation results for specifications synthesized by NetSpec

On the top-level are the benchmarks.
files with [benchmark]-sol.log is the reference specification
in Datalog.
In each directory named after the benchmark names,
stores the generated benchmark.
Files with prefix [x] indicates it is different from the reference
specification.
Otherwise, it is correct.

The synthesis results for the other experiments: active learning,
    randomly drop examples, and debloating from execution traces
    are presented in corrsponding directories.
